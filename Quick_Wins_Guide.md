# QUICK WINS IDENTIFICATION GUIDE
## Extracting Immediate Value from Survey Data

**Purpose:** Transform Q13 (Stop Doing) and Q14 (Start Doing) responses into prioritized action items that can be executed within 30-90 days.

---

## WHY QUICK WINS MATTER

### 1. Momentum
- Demonstrates leadership is listening and acting
- Builds credibility for longer-term transformation
- Creates energy and buy-in for bigger changes

### 2. Capacity Creation
- Stop Doing = Free up time/resources
- Start Doing = Invest freed capacity strategically
- Creates space for medium/long-term initiatives

### 3. Trust Building
- Shows survey wasn't just a checkbox exercise
- Validates that team input drives decisions
- Encourages future participation and honesty

---

## PHASE 1: DATA EXTRACTION

### Step 1: Export and Clean

**From Q13 (Stop Doing):**
1. Copy all responses to a separate sheet
2. Remove duplicates (exactly identical text)
3. Clean obvious typos but preserve meaning
4. Remove non-responses ("N/A", "Nothing", "Not sure")

**From Q14 (Start Doing):**
1. Same process as Q13
2. Separate "start doing" from "do differently" if needed

**Expected volume:** 80-100 unique ideas per question (from ~100 respondents)

---

### Step 2: Initial Categorization

**Read through all responses and create 8-10 broad categories:**

**Common Categories for Q13 (Stop Doing):**
- Meetings/Calls (unnecessary syncs, status updates)
- Manual/Admin Work (data entry, reporting)
- Redundant Processes (duplicate approvals, forms)
- Low-Value Activities (non-core work)
- Tool/System Issues (using broken/outdated tools)
- Communication Overhead (excessive emails, Slack)

**Common Categories for Q14 (Start Doing):**
- Training/Development (skills, tools, processes)
- Tools/Technology (new systems, automation)
- Knowledge Sharing (documentation, best practices)
- Process Improvements (streamline workflows)
- Cross-functional Collaboration (better coordination)
- Customer Focus (more strategic engagement)

**Tag each response with 1-2 categories**

---

## PHASE 2: FREQUENCY ANALYSIS

### Step 3: Identify High-Frequency Items

**Count how many people mentioned similar ideas:**

Use semantic grouping, not exact text matching:
- "Too many status meetings" (23 mentions)
- "Stop unnecessary calls" (18 mentions)
- "Reduce meeting overhead" (12 mentions)
→ **Group as:** "Reduce unnecessary meetings" (53 mentions)

**Create frequency table:**

| Stop Doing Item | Raw Mentions | Grouped Count | % of Respondents |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| Reduce unnecessary meetings | Various | 53 | 53% |
| Automate manual reporting | Various | 41 | 41% |
| Eliminate redundant approvals | Various | 35 | 35% |

**Frequency Threshold:**
- **High frequency:** >30% of respondents (30+ mentions)
- **Medium frequency:** 15-30% (15-30 mentions)
- **Low frequency:** <15% (<15 mentions)

---

### Step 4: Qualitative Validation

**For each high-frequency item, extract 2-3 representative quotes:**

Example:
**Stop Doing: Reduce unnecessary meetings**
- "We spend 20+ hours a week in meetings that could be emails" (R047)
- "Too many status update calls with no outcomes or decisions" (R082)
- "Meeting culture is out of control - need to audit what's actually valuable" (R013)

**Purpose:** Validate that high frequency = genuine pain point, not just noise

---

## PHASE 3: IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### Step 5: Estimate Impact

For each item, rate impact on **3 dimensions:**

#### 5.1 Time Savings (for Stop items)
- **High (3 pts):** Saves >5 hours per person per week
- **Medium (2 pts):** Saves 2-5 hours per person per week
- **Low (1 pt):** Saves <2 hours per person per week

#### 5.2 Value Creation (for Start items)
- **High (3 pts):** Directly increases win rate, customer satisfaction, or revenue
- **Medium (2 pts):** Improves team effectiveness or collaboration
- **Low (1 pt):** Nice to have but not game-changing

#### 5.3 Scope of Impact
- **High (3 pts):** Affects >75% of team
- **Medium (2 pts):** Affects 40-75% of team
- **Low (1 pt):** Affects <40% of team

**Calculate Impact Score:** Average of 3 dimensions (1-3 scale)

**Example:**

| Stop Item | Time Savings | Value | Scope | Impact Score |
|-----------|--------------|-------|-------|--------------|
| Reduce meetings | High (3) | Medium (2) | High (3) | 2.7 |
| Automate reports | High (3) | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 2.3 |
| Stop manual CRM entry | Medium (2) | Low (1) | High (3) | 2.0 |

## PHASE 4: EFFORT ESTIMATION

### Step 6: Estimate Implementation Effort

**Use T-shirt sizing:**

#### Low Effort (1 week or less)
- Leadership decision/announcement
- Policy change
- Stopping an existing practice
- Simple tool adoption

**Examples:**
- "Cancel recurring status meeting"
- "Stop requiring triple approval for demos"
- "Start using ChatGPT for RFP responses"

---

#### Medium Effort (2-8 weeks)
- Process redesign
- Tool procurement + setup
- Training program development
- Cross-team coordination

**Examples:**
- "Implement automated reporting dashboard"
- "Launch AI tool training series"
- "Create shared knowledge base"

---

#### High Effort (>8 weeks)
- System integration
- Major org change
- Custom development
- Require significant budget/resources

**Examples:**
- "Build automated demo environment provisioning"
- "Implement new CRM with AI"
- "Restructure presales organization"

**Quick Wins = Low Effort only**
Medium/High effort → Medium-term roadmap

---

## PHASE 5: PRIORITIZATION

### Step 7: Apply Prioritization Framework

**2x2 Matrix:**

```
        HIGH IMPACT
            |
            |  P1         P2
            |  Quick Wins | Major
            |             | Projects
            |
LOW EFFORT --+------------ HIGH EFFORT
            |
            |  P3         P4
            |  Consider   | Defer
            |
        LOW IMPACT
```

**Priority Definitions:**

**P1 (Quick Wins):** High Impact + Low Effort
- **Timeline:** 0-30 days
- **Approval:** Minimal (director level)
- **Resources:** Existing budget/capacity
- **Communication:** Announce immediately

**P2 (Strategic Projects):** High Impact + High Effort
- **Timeline:** 60-180 days
- **Approval:** VP/C-level
- **Resources:** Budget allocation required
- **Communication:** Roadmap item

**P3 (Consider):** Low Impact + Low Effort
- **Timeline:** 30-90 days
- **Approval:** Team lead
- **Resources:** Spare capacity
- **Communication:** Optional

**P4 (Defer):** Low Impact + High Effort
- **Timeline:** Backlog
- **Approval:** N/A
- **Resources:** N/A
- **Communication:** Politely decline

---

### Step 8: Refine Quick Wins (P1 Items)

**From your P1 list, select top 3-5 using these criteria:**

1. **Clarity:** Is the action concrete and specific?
   - ✗ Bad: "Improve meetings"
   - ✓ Good: "Cancel Monday morning regional sync; replace with async Slack update"

2. **Autonomy:** Can we execute without external dependencies?
   - ✓ Internal decision → Quick win
   - ✗ Requires vendor, IT, legal → Not quick

3. **Measurability:** Can we track impact?
   - ✓ "Hours saved per week" → Measurable
   - ✗ "Better collaboration" → Hard to measure

4. **Visibility:** Will the team notice?
   - ✓ Affects daily work → High visibility
   - ✗ Backend process change → Low visibility

**Final Quick Win Criteria:**
- High frequency (>30% mentioned)
- High impact score (>2.5)
- Low effort (<1 week)
- Passes refinement tests above

---

## PHASE 6: ACTION PLANNING

### Step 9: Create Action Plans

**For each Quick Win, complete this template:**

---

#### QUICK WIN #1: [Name]

**Problem Statement:**
[What's broken? Use quotes from survey]

**Proposed Solution:**
[Specific action to be taken]

**Success Criteria:**
- [Measurable outcome 1]
- [Measurable outcome 2]

**Owner:** [Name/Role]

**Timeline:**
- Announce: [Date]
- Implement: [Date]
- Review: [Date + 30 days]

**Resources Required:**
- Budget: $X (if any)
- People: [Who needs to be involved]
- Tools: [Any tools needed]

**Communication Plan:**
- To team: [Message + channel]
- To leadership: [Update format]

**Risks & Mitigation:**
- Risk: [What could go wrong]
- Mitigation: [How to handle]

**Survey Data Supporting This:**
- Frequency: XX mentions (XX% of team)
- Impact score: X.X
- Representative quotes: [2-3 quotes]

---

### Step 10: Sequence Quick Wins

**Launch in waves:**

**Week 1 (Immediate Impact):**
- Quick Win #1: [Highest impact, most visible]
- Quick Win #2: [Second highest impact]

**Week 2-3 (Build Momentum):**
- Quick Win #3: [High impact, slightly more complex]
- Quick Win #4: [Medium impact, very easy]

**Week 4-6 (Sustain Energy):**
- Quick Win #5: [Addresses different category]
- Additional items from P3 if capacity allows

**Don't launch everything at once:**
- Overwhelming for the team
- Dilutes communication impact
- Harder to measure individual impact
- Risk of execution failure

---

## PHASE 7: MEASUREMENT & COMMUNICATION

### Step 11: Establish Baseline Metrics

**Before implementing, measure:**

For Stop items:
- Hours per week spent on activity (survey or estimate)
- Number of meetings/approvals/reports (quantify)
- Frustration score (1-10 survey question)

For Start items:
- Current capability/maturity level (0-5 scale)
- Current usage/adoption (% of team)
- Desired future state (specific target)

**Example Baseline:**
- **Stop:** Unnecessary meetings
  - Current: Average 8.2 status meetings/week per person
  - Hours: 6.5 hours/week
  - Frustration score: 7.8/10

---

### Step 12: Communication Strategy

#### Announcement (Week 0)

**To the team:**

## EXAMPLE: COMPLETE QUICK WIN

### STOP DOING: Eliminate Redundant Status Meetings

**Survey Data:**
- **Frequency:** 47 mentions (47% of respondents)
- **Impact Score:** 2.8 (Time=3, Value=2.5, Scope=3)
- **Effort:** Low (1 week - leadership decision)
- **Priority:** P1 (Quick Win)

**Representative Quotes:**
- "We have 3 different weekly status meetings that cover the same topics" (R034)
- "Monday morning regional sync is 90% status updates that could be async" (R072)
- "Half my week is meetings about meetings" (R019)

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Audit all recurring presales meetings (Nov 15-20)
2. Cancel/consolidate meetings with >50% status update content
3. Replace with async Slack updates in #presales-weekly-updates
4. Keep only meetings with: decisions required, problem-solving, or strategic discussion

**Success Criteria:**
- Reduce average meetings per person from 8.2 to 5.0 per week
- Save 3+ hours per week per person (300+ hours/week total for team)
- Maintain (or improve) coordination effectiveness (measured via pulse survey)

**Owner:** VP Presales

**Timeline:**
- Nov 18: Announce to team
- Nov 18-22: Meeting audit
- Nov 25: Implement changes (cancel/modify recurring meetings)
- Dec 16: 30-day retrospective

**Resources Required:**
- Budget: $0
- People: VP (2 hours for audit), Directors (30 min each for feedback)
- Tools: Slack #presales-weekly-updates channel (already exists)

**Communication Plan:**

*To team (Nov 18):*
"Based on your survey feedback (47% of you mentioned this!), we're streamlining our meeting structure. Goal: Save you 3+ hours per week for actual work with customers.

What's changing:
- Monday regional syncs → Async Slack updates
- [Other specific meetings]

What's staying:
- Weekly team problem-solving session (decision-focused)
- Bi-weekly strategy discussions

Effective Nov 25. Your thoughts? DM me or reply in #feedback"

*To leadership (Nov 18):*
"Implementing first quick win from survey: reducing meeting overhead by 35%. Expected ROI: 300+ hours/week freed up for customer-facing work. Will track impact via pulse survey."

**Risks & Mitigation:**
- **Risk:** Critical information falls through cracks in async model
  - **Mitigation:** Create clear async update template; monitor for 30 days; add back tactical sync if needed

- **Risk:** Team feels less connected
  - **Mitigation:** Emphasize remaining meetings are higher quality; add optional coffee chats; monthly all-hands

- **Risk:** Directors resist losing control/visibility
  - **Mitigation:** Async updates provide better paper trail than meetings; directors can request 1:1s as needed

**Baseline Metrics (Nov 15):**
- Average meetings per person per week: 8.2
- Hours in meetings per week: 6.5
- Team frustration with meetings: 7.8/10

**Target Metrics (Dec 16):**
- Average meetings per person per week: ≤5.0
- Hours in meetings per week: ≤4.0
- Team satisfaction with meeting structure: ≥7/10

**30-Day Review Questions:**
- Did we hit our targets?
- Did communication suffer?
- What did people do with freed time?
- Do we need to course-correct?
- What's next quick win?

## PITFALLS TO AVOID

### 1. Analysis Paralysis
**Problem:** Spending weeks perfecting the analysis
**Solution:** 80/20 rule - identify top 5 quick wins and execute

### 2. Scope Creep
**Problem:** Quick wins turn into major projects
**Solution:** If it takes >1 week, it's not a quick win → medium-term roadmap

### 3. No Follow-Through
**Problem:** Announce with fanfare, never implement
**Solution:** Assign clear owners and deadlines; track publicly

### 4. No Measurement
**Problem:** Can't prove impact
**Solution:** Define 1-2 metrics upfront; measure before/after

### 5. Solving for the Vocal Minority
**Problem:** Focusing on 1-2 complaints, not 30+ mentions
**Solution:** Use frequency data; validate with broader team

### 6. Forgetting to Close the Loop
**Problem:** Team doesn't know action was taken based on their input
**Solution:** Always connect quick wins back to survey: "You said X, we did Y"
