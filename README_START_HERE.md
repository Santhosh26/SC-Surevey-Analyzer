## 💡 PRO TIPS

### 1. **Use AI as Your Research Assistant**

Don't code manually if you don't have to:

```
Prompt: "I have 100 responses to 'What's the future mission of presales?'

Here are 40 sample responses:
[paste responses]

Identify 5-7 major themes with:
1. Theme name and code (4-6 letters)
2. Clear definition
3. Inclusion criteria
4. % distribution estimate
5. 2 example quotes per theme

Use the following sample themes as inspiration but adapt to what you see:
- TRUST: Trusted advisor/strategic partner
- COMPLEX: Navigate technical complexity
- VALUE: Demonstrate business ROI
- EDUCATE: Market education/evangelism
- ACCEL: Accelerate customer success"
```

**Then validate and refine what AI suggests.**

---

### 2. **Don't Aim for Perfect**

This is analysis, not accounting. You need:
- Directionally correct themes
- Reasonable frequency estimates
- Authentic representative quotes
- Actionable insights

You don't need:
- 99% inter-rater reliability
- Academic rigor
- Perfect statistical significance
- Every edge case accounted for

**80/20 rule applies:** 20% of themes will drive 80% of insights.

---

### 3. **Focus on Triangulation**

The magic is in cross-referencing:
- Q2 (future mission) + Q11 (human value) = what makes us unique?
- Q6 (want AI for) + Q7 (use AI now) = training gap
- Q12 (challenges) + Q13 (stop doing) = low-hanging fruit
- Q14 (start doing) + Q5 (skills needed) = capability building

**Look for the story across questions, not just within them.**

---

### 4. **Quick Wins = Trust Currency**

The fastest way to build credibility:
1. Week 1: Announce top 3 quick wins
2. Week 2: Implement them
3. Week 4: Share impact data

This creates permission for bigger changes later.

**Example quick win sequence:**
- Week 1: "Cancel Monday status meeting" (immediate relief)
- Week 2: "Launch AI tool training" (capability building)
- Week 3: "Share competitive battle cards" (enablement)

Each builds on the last. Team sees momentum.

---

### 5. **Make It Visual**

Numbers alone are boring. Create:
- Word clouds for each question
- 2x2 matrices for prioritization
- Before/after comparisons
- Theme frequency bar charts
- AI adoption funnel

**Tools:** Excel charts, Miro boards, PowerPoint SmartArt, or even hand-drawn on whiteboard for working sessions.

---

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ❌ Don't:

1. **Code responses before reading them all**
   - Risk: Miss important themes because you locked in too early
   - Fix: Read 30-50 responses before finalizing theme codes

2. **Create 15+ themes per question**
   - Risk: Analysis paralysis, can't see the forest for trees
   - Fix: Force yourself to 5-7 themes max; merge similar ones

3. **Only report data, not insights**
   - Risk: Leadership says "interesting but so what?"
   - Fix: Every finding needs "So What?" and "Now What?"

4. **Ignore contradictions**
   - Risk: Miss strategic tensions that need decisions
   - Fix: Explicitly call out competing priorities

5. **Over-promise on quick wins**
   - Risk: Credibility loss if you can't deliver
   - Fix: Under-promise, over-deliver

6. **Forget to close the loop with the team**
   - Risk: Team thinks survey was performative
   - Fix: Always attribute actions back to their feedback
