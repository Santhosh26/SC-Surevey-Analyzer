# INTERNATIONAL PRESALES ALL-HANDS SURVEY
## Executive Summary & Strategic Recommendations

**Date:** November 2025  
**Respondents:** ~100 International Presales Team Members  
**Analysis Period:** [Date Range]  
**Prepared by:** [Your Name/Team]

---

## EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

[2-3 paragraph summary of the most critical findings. What's the headline story?]

**Example:**
"The International Presales team stands at a critical inflection point. While there is strong consensus (47%) around evolving into trusted strategic advisors, current operational realities—dominated by time constraints (41%) and tool limitations (35%)—prevent the team from delivering on this vision. The analysis reveals a stark gap between AI aspiration (52% want to use AI for content generation and analysis) and actual adoption (only 20% use AI tools regularly). Most critically, respondents identify relationship-building and empathy (38%) as their uniquely human value proposition, yet current challenges center on having no time for strategic customer engagement. This analysis provides a roadmap for bridging these gaps through immediate quick wins, medium-term capability building, and long-term strategic transformation."
